Simple Decision Tree: Golf Game Classification

Decision Tree

This project demonstrates the use of a Decision Tree to classify golf game data based on weather conditions.

Description

The project leverages the scikit-learn library to create a Decision Tree model that predicts whether it is suitable to play golf based on weather data, including climate, temperature, humidity, and wind.

How to Use

Ensure you have the NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn libraries installed.

Place the 'golf_df.xlsx' file in the same directory as the code.

Run the Python code to create and train the Decision Tree model.

The trained model will be ready to make predictions.

Tree Visualization

The project includes a visualization of the created Decision Tree. The tree visualization can be generated by running the code in the file.
